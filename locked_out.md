# Locked out

## Setting Up a New Password

For your first login, you may choose any password. This password will be encrypted and
stored in a file named `PASSWORD` within the ComfyUI project folder.

## Resetting a Forgotten Password

If you forget your password, you can reset it by deleting the `PASSWORD` file found in
`<ComfyUI project folder>/login`. After doing this, you will be able to log in again using a
new password of your choice.

## Removing the Login Feature

To disable the login feature, you can either:

1. Use the [ComfyUI-Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) to uninstall
   it, or

2. Manually delete the ComfyUI-Login folder located in the `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/`
   directory. Then, restart ComfyUI for the changes to take effect.
